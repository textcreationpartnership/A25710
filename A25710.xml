            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſhewing how the next Houſe of Commons by Law may be purged of its diſ-affected
Members.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Great King,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHom God has choſen to be his Anointed, and for whoſe Preſervation Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miracles
were done to that degree, as to joy the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and confound the Incredulous; It was for this
that God touched the heart of a Woman, and made her become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Judeth</hi> to paſs
through the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Camp, at the ſame time that <hi>Bethulia</hi> was beſieged,
to the end ſhe might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kingdom and People from the fury of the Enemy; <hi>Judeth</hi>
deliver'd <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thulia</hi> and her diſtreſſed People by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the dead Head of the
<hi>Aſſyrians</hi> General; And this delivers the People of three Kingdoms from the
<hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> of Uſurpers, by bravely carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the living Head of
theſe Three Kingdoms. It was for This that ſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly <hi>look'd Death in the
Face,</hi> and expos'd her Life and Fortune to the worſt of Fates. It was for This that
<hi>Gold</hi> was to Peaſants of no other value than <hi>Dirt,</hi> when it was only to be
purchaſed by delivering up the Innocent into the hands of the Guilty. But that which makes it the
more remarkable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of admiration, is, That God ſhould make uſe of ſuch Inſtruments
to effect Your Preſervation, as have now lately been Accuſed, Condemned and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for
attempting to deſtroy You, whom (with the hazard of their Lives) they had formerly preſerved.
Nay, for this it was, that even the <hi>Romiſh Priests</hi> themſelves were inſtrumental.</p>
            <p>Sir, God took You out of the hands of your Enemies, at a time when all the world deſpair'd of
ſeeing You ſeated on any other Throne than that on which Your Royal Father acted the laſt
Scene of a Horrid and Bloudy Tragedy. Who can repeat the buying and ſelling of a King, the beſt
that ever People had, and this by his own Vaſſals? his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by them? his being
betrayed by them? his being judged by them? his being condemned by them? and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murdered by
them in the Face of Heaven and the whole World? Who (I ſay) can repeat theſe things without
Horrour and Execration?</p>
            <p>God miraculouſly delivered You out of the hands of <hi>a barbarous people,</hi> who ſought
you for no other end than <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy You;</hi> but he mercifully with-held the blow which
all the world believ'd was inevitably falling on You; for there was no one could avert it but God
alone; And he did it, that we might one day ſee you <hi>ſeated on the Throne of Glory.</hi>
'Tis true, he with-held You from Us for ſome time; but it was that You might <hi>return</hi> the
more glorious and welcome, and to make Us ſenſible of the ill was done in <hi>baniſhing Him
from us</hi> whom God had appointed to Rule and Govern us.</p>
            <p>I believe there are few alive now who liv'd then, who have forgotten <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity this
Kingdom groaned under at that time,</hi> and the ſad Cataſtrophe attended Your abſence.</p>
            <p>It was a ſad thing to ſee <hi>your</hi> 3 <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms governed by the Murderers of your
Royal Father;</hi> to ſee <hi>Mechanicks</hi> ſeated in the Throne of <hi>Princes,</hi> and the
giddy-headed <hi>Mobile</hi> to Lord it over the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Coblers</hi> and
<hi>Bricklayers</hi> turn <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> whilſt the Biſhops have their Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets pull'd
over their ears, and the beſt of the Clergy turn'd out of their Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; at the ſame time
their Wives and Children going a begging; to hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Sedition</hi> and
<hi>Treaſon</hi> daily prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Pulpits; to ſee the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Party</hi> dance
attendance every day to a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60284:2"/>damn'd Committee, made up of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of formal

                  </gap>he
Riches of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whilſt honeſt men turn'd Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts; to ſee thoſe men who had
ſerv'd the King your Father with their Bloud and Fortunes, by theſe Governours Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
Impriſoned and Tortured, and for no other Crime than becauſe they had the honeſty to be
<hi>Loyal;</hi> to ſee the beſt of theſe men forced to buy their own Eſtates three or four
times over of theſe Villains, who had ſeiz'd them as their own, whilſt others of the meaner
ſort had not Bread to put in their Heads.</p>
            <p>But God was pleaſed at his proper time to commiſerate our Sufferings, by out-doing his
former Prodigies which were acted in your Preſervation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring You to a People who lived
with no other hope than deſpair of ever ſeeing You ſeated upon the Imperial Throne of
<hi>Great Britain.</hi> Sir, 'tis undoubted Your Reſtauration was decreed by Heaven, and to
confirm which, God (as it were with his own hand) led You into Your Kingdoms, that there You might
be made Sacred, and have your Temples incircled with a Crown; and then it was he conſigned a
Scepter into Your Sacred hand, with which at the ſame time he commanded You to Rule, and Govern
your People in the ſtrict obſervance of Juſtice and Equity; and after that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Model
which he himſelf hath left you, in his Sacred and Divine Laws, and not according to thoſe
exorbitant Laws the ignorant Rabble, and their Abettors would preſcribe you.</p>
            <p>What joy was it at that time to all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearts to ſee You <hi>Return</hi>
in Triumph from your long <hi>Exile?</hi> to ſee You not only received into your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but
into the hearts of Your People; who looked upon You as no other than <hi>the Angel of Peace ſent
by the living God to comfort an afflicted People and to redeem them from Slavery?</hi> It was then
that we were all big with hopes no longer to ſee our Laws (which are the beſt in the world)
trampled under foot by <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers:</hi> It was then that we gave our ſelves the
aſſurance that we ſhould ſee <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> equally poyſed in one
Ballance, and neither to out-weigh each other, It was then that we expected to ſee Impiety
baniſhed out of your Kingdoms, as an Impoſture, and Virtue rais'd to that Throne it deſerves,
that is, <hi>to be ſeated on the right hand of Kings:</hi> And then it was that we believ'd that
Loyalty ſhould nobly be rewarded for their Fidelity and paſt Sufferings; and the <hi>Diſloyal
Traytor</hi> puniſhed, and for ever baniſhed from the Influence of your Bounty; the performance
of which had eſtabliſh'd to Your People a Kingdom of <hi>Peace,</hi> and we ſhould have
ſeen a <hi>Golden Age</hi> to flouriſh.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, there are ſome men who are bold, and take leave to ſay, You have not poiſed the
Ballance equal, and your Clemency and Mercy have infinitely out-weighed the Scale of Juſtice;
That you have miſ-placed your Bounty; And (they now begin to fear) You have done that you ſaid
you never would; Sacrificed your Friends to pleaſe your Enemies; And this they ſay hath
alienated your Friends, and made their <hi>Loyal hearts</hi> grow cold, and freeze; And bold Mouths
ſpit their Allegiance out. This hath ſo far prevailed upon your Enemies, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them
that their former ill-doings were well done, which makes them bold to act them over again. Sir,
ſuch are their proceedings, that You appear no longer now as a King to govern the People, but as
a Pupil to be governed by them. This makes us fear you have delivered your Royal Scepter into their
hands; And if ſo, you have made your Self and Friends one Sacrifice to the Fury and Malice of
your Enemies; So that we have nothing now in proſpect, but <hi>the Old Tragedy act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over
again;</hi> where we behold a Stage filled with <hi>Rapine, Sword, Fire, Blond</hi> and
<hi>Maſsacres;</hi> with the Deſolation and Overthrow of three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dread Sovereign,</hi> You are the Object on which all our eyes are fixed; You are the Center
in which the hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of all <hi>Loyal hearts</hi> are lodged. <hi>Now is the time</hi>
to make your ſelf a King, and us a happy people <hi>or never.</hi> If You put on an unſhaken
Reſolution. You will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and ſtrengthen Your Friends to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60284:2"/>ſtand by you to the laſt; which we are
reſolved to do, if you force us not from you; And this will not a little tame the Inſolency of
thoſe bad men who brand all thoſe who ſtand up for your Rights and Prerogatives with that
ſcandalous Name <hi>Papist.</hi> All thoſe honeſt Gentlemen who had a deſire to ſerve
their Country, by being Parliament-men, becauſe they oppoſed the <hi>Rump Faction,</hi> they
and all their Friends were <hi>Papiſts, rank bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd Papiſts.</hi> If theſe men can make
us <hi>Papists</hi> at this rate, we ſhall have <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> among us before we know where we
are; and really I think we have no great reaſon to be ſo much afraid on't; for 'tis come to
that, that you ſhall not hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

preſently he is a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, you have been ſilent too long, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince You have given us your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al word,
<hi>That our Laws ſhall be Your Rule and Meaſure, by which You are reſolved to Govern,</hi>
let us hear you roar like the King of Lion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when next you meet your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; cry <hi>ha!</hi>
to them, and <hi>ha!</hi> again, till (like your Predeceſſor <hi>H.</hi> VIII.) you make them
tremble. Sir, remember you are as well King of <hi>France</hi> as <hi>England;</hi> therefore let
not the <hi>French</hi> King be a greater Monarch than your ſelf: At leaſt for a time ſhew
yourſelf as abſolute over your people as he is, and ſince that Law is Your Meaſure, like
him tell them <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo,</hi> and take off the head of that man who ſhall dare
to open his Lips to contradict it; And be aſſured that this way of Governing ſhall gain you
more Friends in one day, than all your complyance to <hi>the unreaſonable demands of your
Parliament</hi> ſhall gain you in an age.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to take from the Commons that old Theme <hi>Religion,</hi> or elſe you muſt
never expect any buſineſs to be done by them, either for the good of your ſelf, or your
Kingdom. If we muſt have a <hi>Change</hi> or <hi>Reformation</hi> in our ſpiritual
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let it be done by ſpiritual men, the Biſhops, and ſuch who underſtand what
Religion is: But for ſuch men whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is chiefly among Dogs &amp; Horſes, Women
and Wine, to be perpetually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new <hi>Reformations</hi> in Religion, is the moſt
prepoſterous thing in the world.</p>
            <p>What a monſtrous thing it is to ſee the Tail pretend to more Wiſdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in Government than the Head! We have too ſadly experienced what it is to live under this dam'd
<hi>Rump Government;</hi> therefore, for Heavens ſake, Sir, let us have no more on't.</p>
            <p>Sir, as God was pleas'd to perform won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at your Preſervation and Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo
hath he done no leſs all the time of your Government: For (ſetting aſide the precipice into
which your Father fell, and in it was irrecoverably loſt, which ſtill lies open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fore the
Gates of your Palace, ſo that 'tis not poſſible for You to enter in, or out, but you muſt
neceſſarily <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your Fathers ſad Fate.</hi> The Peal that theſe men daily ring in
your ears, which was your Fathers Knell:) ſetting aſide, I ſay, theſe things: Heaven and
Earth have conſpired daily to alarm you, and bid you arm your ſelf againſt the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
and damn'd Conſpiracies, which are hourly acting againſt your Life and Government.</p>
            <p>Sir, the firſt thing you are to do is to know your Enemies, and then to arm your ſelf
againſt them: You cannot have forgotten thoſe men by whom your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father fell, and
purſued you to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; Theſe are the men, Sir, who ſtrike ſo boldly at your Crown,
therefore beware your Head: You cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſwade your ſelf that the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the
Father can ever love the Son. But leaſt your Majeſty ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake theſe men, and think
them to be your Friends, our famous <hi>Salamancha</hi> Doctor hath unmask'd them unto you; For he
ſays, (and what he ſays with us is Goſpel) <hi>That they are Papiſts in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquerade,
diſguiſed in the Habit and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Godly Brethren.</hi> So that 'tis to be hop'd your
Majeſty will truſt none of them, nor any thing that looks like this kind of Cattle. We humbly
therefore beg that the next Parliament you will take aview of your Houſe of Commons, that You may
know the Members of which it is compos'd; and if there be any of theſe diſguis'd Papiſts
there, that they may be <hi>turn'd out;</hi> that is not a place for them; for the Law ſays,
<hi>No Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt ſhall Sit in the Houſe.</hi> If therfore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60284:3"/>there be any there who had their hands imbrewed in
your Fathers bloud, they are diſguiſed Papiſts, they muſt <hi>out</hi> alſo. If there be
any there who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheath'd their Swords againſt their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign, and appeared in
<hi>open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> againſt him, they are the ſame, they muſt out too; for they are all
Papiſts in Maſquerade. Or if there be any of the Sons of theſe men, they are the ſame
Fleſh and Bloud, and they'l prove themſelves no Baſtards i'l warrant you; they have ſuck'd
in their Fathers <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> and bloudy Nature with their Mill which 'tis to be feared
they will never diſgeſt ſo long as they have an hour to live; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Theſe muſt
<hi>out</hi> too. And when the Houſe is thus purg'd of theſe kind of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, we may hope to
ſee good times again, and not till then; For believe it, Sir, they are are ſo glutted with the
Spoils and Sweet of their <hi>last Rebellion,</hi> that they will now be <hi>Caeſars</hi> or
nothing; which Heaven and your endeavours muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh with all my ſoul that what the Prophet <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may not truly be verified in the people of this Nation.
<hi>God hath ſent among them a ſpirit of giddineſs, and made them reel up and down in all
their actions like drunken men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, great and terrible are the menaces which God thunders out by the mouth of holy
<hi>Job,</hi> againſt thoſe who wander from the true way of Juſtice. <hi>God</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>ſuffereth theſe wiſe Counſellors to fall into the hazards of ſenſelſs men. God
maketh the Judges ſtupid, taketh away the Sword and Belt from Kings to ingirt their Reins with a
Cord; God maketh the Prieſts to appear Infamous, ſupplanteth the Principal of the people,
changeth the Lips of Truth-ſpeakers, taketh away the Doctrine of Old men, and powreth out
Contempt upon Princes,</hi> Job 12.</p>
            <p>But that theſe things may not fall upon this Kingdom, and that they may be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented,
be pleas'd, Great Sir, to hear the Courſel that a great Stateſman gave to the Governours of the
Empire; and it is this:</p>

            <p>Sir, when we ſhall behold theſe things practiced within your Dominions, we ſhall conclude
that all theſe prodigies which have been done in your Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſtauration were
performed by Heaven for no other end than that you ſhould be that darling Prince to make your
Kingdoms flouriſh, and Us a happy people; which we all promiſe our ſelves, and that we
ſhall ſee you the greateſt of Monarchs. It was to Princes that the Angel in the
<hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſpeaks theſe words: <hi>He who ſhall overcome and keep my works unto
the end, I will give him power over Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron; and as
the Veſsel of the Potter they ſhall be broken.</hi>
